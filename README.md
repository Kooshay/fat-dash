## Usage

### Upload some challenge files
1. Click on the upload icon on the top left.
2. Select all challenge files created from the game. E.g. `<Your steam lib folder>\steamapps\common\FPSAimTrainer\FPSAimTrainer\stats`
3. Crunch some numbers.

### Widgets

#### Challenge History
See your most recent challenges and compare measures like score with the scenario average. Challenges can be filtered by date and scenario - just click on the filter icon to the right of the table header name. Choose and switch between a measure to display for all challenges.

#### Time Line
Track your progress on some measure over a period of time. Filter by scenario and measure by clicking somewhere on the widget header bar. See Graph Controls for further details.

### Graph controls
- Drag to zoom in and double-click to return to the original graph. Alternative: Zoom and Autoscale buttons at the top right of widget.
- Drag the graph corners to zoom along one axis
- Double-click x or y axis to autoscale on a single axis
- Hover over a graph point to get its coordinates
- Hold <kbd>shift</kbd> + Left Mouse to move around in the graph. Alternatives: Drag an axis or press the pan-button at the top right of the graph 

## Optimizations
Currently, imported csv files are not saved (yet) - after closing the tab, next time files are to be reimported. Simple solution: Keep the tab open, if you want to import more files. Most likely file import speed is limited by your disk performance. Saving all challenge files on a SSD partition can really benefit import time. Also, reimporting files should happend much faster second time due to disk cache.

## Compatibility
### Browser
Just use an up-to-date browser. Tested with
- Firefox 63 - should work with any decent version 55+ or even older
- Chromium 73 - should work with any half decent Chrome version
- Don't get your hands dirty with IE ðŸ˜‰. Also I am not sure concerning Safari browser.

### csv-files support
- starting at Game Version 1.0.2
- only challenges (not tested with free-to-play sessions)
